# NUC Things
This repo contains various experiments around cramming things into an 8th-gen NUC chassis. In particular, a M.2 capture card.

## HDMI Socket Mount (`footer.scad`, `panel1.scad`, `panel2.scad`, `topper.scad`)
An attempt to mount 4 HDMI ribbon cable adapters inside the NUC, without extendign its size. Ultimately doomed to failure due to a lack of clearance.

## HDMI Riser (`hdmi-riser.scad`)
Attempt #2, this time replacing the bottom of the chassis with a riser that provides space for the hdmi jacks and a 60mm fan for cooling. [It works.](https://twitter.com/gramofdata/status/1305327443776077827)
